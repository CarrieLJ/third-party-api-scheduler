# Challenge 5 Module - Third-Party-API-Scheduler

## Description
To utilize my new learned skills to create a daily scheduler that saves entered text by hours. This project will help me map out my day and stay on top of items. I learned that I will need a second set of eyes to look over my code. I'm not perfect, and I need to accept that and be proud of what I can do. I've also learned that there isn't always a shorten code (example: you may have to list each hour out in it's own block). I also feel that I have just now learned to not spend so much time on one specific thing. I need to reach out for help even if my pride is hurt a bit. 

## Usage
When you open the web page, today's date will appear with blocked out hours from 8am to 4pm. Enter in your task items or a description of your needs during your specific time block. Once all text for that time block is entered, click the save button. The save button saves your text into the local storage, therefore if you exit out of the page or refresh, the text is still there for you. The gray colored text area means we have passed that time frame, the pink text area is the current hour, and the green text area is the future hours.
